This is a simple application that utilizes Python and SQLite. It is a simple coffee bean tracker where you can record the beans you've tried, how you prepared them, and their
relative score. This then places them in a SQLite table and using this table you can view all recorded beans, see all beans based off name, and find the best preparation method
for each bean. This is a simple app that was developed to learn more about SQL, here is a demo. (Note: it is run through the terminal)
